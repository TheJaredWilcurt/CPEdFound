      <ol class="loweralpha">
        <li>The Corporation shall indemnify any person as of right who is or was a Director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving as a Director, officer, employee, or agent of another corporation, partnership, or other enterprise at the request of the Corporation, against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, penalties, and amounts paid in settlement reasonably incurred by such person, to the fullest extent now or hereafter permitted by law, in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding (whether actual or threatened, civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, or in connection with an appeal relating thereto), in which such person may be involved as a party or otherwise by reason of being or having been a Director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation or of such other organization; provided, such person acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, in a manner which he had no reasonable cause to believe was unlawful. The termination of any claim, action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval), conviction, or upon a plea of <u>nolo contendere</u> or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action, suit, or proceeding, in a manner which he had reasonable cause to believe was unlawful.</li>
        <li>Any Director, officer or employee of the Corporation who has been successful as a party on the merits or otherwise in his defense of any claim, action, suit, or proceeding referred to in the first sentence of Section 8.1(a) shall be indemnified as of right against expenses (including attorneys' fees) reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith (except to the extent covered by insurance).</li>
        <li>Except as provided in Section 8.1(b) above, any indemnification under Section8.1(a) shall be made by the Corporation only upon a determination that indemnification of the particular Director, officer, employee, or agent is proper in the circumstances because such person has met the applicable standards of conduct set forth in Section 8.1(a). Such determination shall be made (i) by the Board of Directors of the Corporation by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of members of the Board of Directors who were not parties to such claim, action, suit, or proceeding, or (ii) if such a quorum is not obtainable or if so directed by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of members of the Board of Directors who were not parties to such claim, action, suit, or proceeding, by independent legal counsel (who may be regular counsel of the Corporation or other disinterested person(s), such counsel or person(s) being hereafter called the "referee") in a written opinion. The person claiming indemnification shall, if requested, appear before the referee and answer questions which the referee deems relevant and shall be given ample opportunity to present to the referee evidence upon which he relies for indemnification. The Corporation shall, at the request of the referee, make available facts, opinions or other evidence in any way relevant to the referee's findings which are within the possession or control of the Corporation.</li>
        <li>The indemnification provided by this Section 8.1 shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which a Director, officer, employee, or agent may be entitled under any by­ law, resolution, agreement, or otherwise, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation, and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person. The indemnification provided by this Section 8.1 shall be applicable to claims, actions, suits, or proceedings made or commenced after the adoption hereof, arising from acts or omissions to act occurring whether before or after the adoption hereof.</li>
        <li>The Corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or who is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a Director, officer, employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against such person and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify him against such liability under the provisions of this Section 8.1, together with expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with his defense thereof; provided that when and to the extent that the Corporation has purchased and maintained such insurance, it shall have no duty under this Section 8.1 to indemnify any such person to the extent such liability is covered by such insurance.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>No gifts or other contributions to the Corporation shall be accepted by the Corporation if the use or expenditure of such gift or other contribution is subject to any condition which is inconsistent with the purposes of the Corporation as stated herein.</p>

Provided, however, such contract or transaction shall be at arm's length and not violative of the proscriptions of these Articles against the Corporation's use or application of its funds for private benefit.</p>

      <ol class="loweralpha">

      <p>The Corporation reserves to the Directors of the Corporation the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provisions contained in the Articles of Incorporation or in any amendment hereto, in any manner now or hereafter prescribed or permitted by the Act or any amendment thereto; provided, nevertheless, that such power of amendment shall not authorize any amendment which would have the effect of disqualifying the Corporation as an exempt organization under the provisions of Section 50l(c)(3) of the Code, or such equivalent provision as may hereafter exist from time to time.</p>

      <p><u>Section 8.7</u>: <u>By-Laws</u>.</p>
